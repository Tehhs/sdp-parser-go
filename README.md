# SDP - Some Dumb Parser 

This is meant to be a dumb parser to mimics another parser I had made in JS some time ago (Shelby). Shelby didn't get far, but it partially worked. 

This parser is being made with no prior knowledge on how parsers work. I'm just winging it and hopefully I get something half functional out of this.
